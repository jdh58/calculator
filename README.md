# JS, HTML, CSS Calculator

This is a calculator I built using vanilla JS, DOM manipulation,
HTML, CSS Grid, Flexbox, and other skills. It is fully functional
and meant to calculate two numbers at a time (you can string
together operations to your heart's desire).

Potential Features List:
-Keyboard Support
-Keep an operator highlighted until it's no longer in use
-Backspace button
